makes one redis-server slave of two master redis-servers

requires perl, socat

creates three socats: one for the slave and two others for the masters

when slave runs 'sync' it is sent to first master and reply sent back to slave

after 15s (enough to become slave of first master) 'sync' is sent to second master, replies ignored

data sent back and forth are printed but is mostly unreadable

it is possible to send second master's AOF to client to overwrite first master's data, in case AOF is available
